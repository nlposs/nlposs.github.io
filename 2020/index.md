# 2nd Workshop for Natural Language Processing Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) <br>

### 11 or 12 Nov 2020 @ [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/)

<br><br>

With great scientific breakthrough comes solid engineering and open communities. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has benefited greatly from the open culture in sharing knowledge, data, and software. The primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing, and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS), which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. Our secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software collaborations and comparisons.

We refer to Natural Language Processing OSS as an umbrella term that not only covers traditional syntactic, semantic, phonetic, and pragmatic applications; we extend the definition to include task-specific applications (e.g., machine translation, information retrieval, question-answering systems), low-level string processing that contains valid linguistic information (e.g. Unicode creation for new languages, language-based character set definitions) and machine learning/artificial intelligence frameworks with functionalities focusing on text applications.

In the earlier days of NLP, linguistic software was often monolithic and the learning curve to install, use, and extend the tools was steep and frustrating. More often than not, NLP OSS developers/users interact in siloed communities within the ecologies of their respective projects. In addition to the engineering aspects of NLP software, the open source movement has brought a community aspect that we often overlook in building impactful NLP technologies.

An example of precious OSS knowledge comes from SpaCy developer [Montani (2017)](https://ines.io/blog/spacy-commercial-open-source-nlp), who shared her thoughts and challenges of maintaining commercial NLP-OSS, such as handling open issues on the issue tracker, model release and packaging strategy and monetizing NLP OSS for sustainability.

More recently, the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) created by Hugging Face, has gathered much interest from the community by open sourcing implementations to use pretrained weights of BERT-like models, in a clean and well-organized structure. The interoperability of various pretrained models trained with different tools in one library enables quick benchmarking across the models, as well as developing best practices for reading/saving serialized interoperable models.

We hope that the NLP-OSS workshop becomes the intellectual forum to collate various open source knowledge beyond the scientific contribution, announce new software/features, promote the open source culture and best practices that go beyond the conferences.

## Submission information

Authors are invited to submit a

- Full paper up to 8 pages of content or
- Short paper up to 4 pages of content

Submissions can be non-archival and be presented in the NLP-OSS workshop, but we would still require at least a 4-page submission so that reviewers have enough information to make the acceptance/rejection decision. This non-archival option is helpful for author(s) who wants to publish or had published the work elsewhere and would like to present/discuss pertinent NLP-OSS related work to the workshop PCs and attendees.

All papers are allowed unlimited but sensible pages for references. Final camera-ready versions will be allowed an additional page of content to address reviewers' comments.

Due to the nature of open source software, we find it a bit tricky to "anonymize" "open source". For this reason, we don't require your publication to be anonymous. However, if you prefer your paper to be anonymized, please mask any identifiable phrase with REDACTED. We have an option setup in softconf so that you can explicitly opt-in / opt-out of anonymity. 

Submission should be formatted according to the EMNLP 2020 LaTeX or MS Word templates at [https://2020.emnlp.org/files/emnlp2020-templates.zip](https://2020.emnlp.org/files/emnlp2020-templates.zip).

Submissions should be uploaded to Softconf conference management system at [https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/nlposs/](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/nlposs/).

**Note:** Paper can be [dual-submitted](https://2020.emnlp.org/call-for-papers) to both EMNLP 2020 and the NLP-OSS workshop.

## Workshop Structure

To promote closer interaction, all accepted publications will be presented in the poster format and be required to give a 1 slide (90 seconds) introduction of their work at the beginning of the session. For the rest of the workshop, invited talks will be given by developers and maintainers of prominent NLP-OSS projects and we plan to close the workshop with a panel session with the invited speakers and the audience of the workshop.
